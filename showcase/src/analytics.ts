/**
 * Analytics — Google Analytics 4, in one file.
 *
 * Every event this site can send is a named function below. Pages call `trackSponsorClick(...)`;
 * no page ever calls `gtag('event', ...)` itself. That is the whole point of the file: the event
 * taxonomy and its parameter names are readable in one place, so a report built in the GA4 UI
 * cannot be quietly orphaned by a page renaming its event, and a new page cannot invent a
 * seventeenth spelling of "the visitor clicked a sponsor".
 *
 * SPONSOR REPORTING IS THE PRIMARY JOB. Sponsors are sent an impression count, a click count and
 * the click-through rate between them, so both halves of that ratio have to be measured on the
 * same terms:
 *   - `sponsor_impression` fires when a sponsor's card is actually on screen (IntersectionObserver,
 *     not merely "the drawer was opened"), once per sponsor per drawer opening.
 *   - `sponsor_click` fires on the outbound click, carrying the same `sponsor_id`.
 * `sponsor_id` is a stable slug, never the display name: a sponsor that rebrands must not split
 * into two rows in a report that spans the rename.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COLLECTED: nothing typed by the visitor except exhibit-search terms
 * (which are matched against a fixed list of exhibit titles), no form input, no identifiers of our
 * own making, and no attempt to join a visit to a person. See the privacy drawer in `content.ts` —
 * it is written to match this file, and changing what is collected here means changing it there.
