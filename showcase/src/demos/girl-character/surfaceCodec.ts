/**
 * Rebuild the figure's surfaces from the encoded stream that ships inside this bundle.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The surfaces used to be fetched as a 107.6 MB binary, which made the demo depend on
 * an external asset. Writing that file out as TypeScript numbers is not an option -- 2,109,210 vertices
 * and 4,220,724 triangles come to about 203 MB of source -- so the question was what in it is actually
 * information.
 *
 * MOST OF IT IS NOT. The surfaces were contoured with Surface Nets, which places exactly one vertex per
 * sign-changing voxel cell and emits one quad per sign-changing grid edge. Two consequences, both
 * verified against the shipped data on all sixteen nodes before any of this was written:
 *
 *   the INDEX BUFFER is derivable from cell adjacency          50.6 MB of the 107.6
 *   the NORMALS are derivable from the rebuilt triangles       another 25 MB
 *
 * What is left is the cell list, the sub-cell offsets and the colours, which encode to 8.00 bytes per
 * vertex measured -- a fifth of the binary, and small enough to sit in a module.
 *
 * The stream layout, per node, in this order:
 *
 *   cells       varint deltas of the linear cell index, ascending. Sorted deltas are almost always 1,
 *               which is what gets a 5-byte coordinate down to a single byte.
 *   offsets     the position inside the cell, 8 bits per axis. A cell is 1.5-2.5 mm, so a step is 6-10
 *               microns -- three orders finer than the cell, which is the real resolution limit.
 *   colours     8 bits per channel, in the linear working space, exactly as baked.
 *   edges       one byte per cell: for each axis, whether the grid edge leaving it changes sign (bit
 *               2*axis) and whether the quad winds the other way (bit 2*axis+1). This is what replaces
 *               the index buffer.
 *   exceptions  a varint count, then four vertex indices per quad, for the handful the reduction cannot
 *               express. On the default level that was 18 quads in 2.11 million; carrying them verbatim
 *               is what makes the rebuild exact rather than nearly exact.
