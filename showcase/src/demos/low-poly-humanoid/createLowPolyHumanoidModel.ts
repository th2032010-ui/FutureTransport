/**
 * Strand flow for the hair, as a generated roughness map.
 *
 * WHY ROUGHNESS AND NOT COLOUR. The obvious way to draw streaks is an albedo map, and it would break
 * the measurement this model is scored by: `hair_structure.py` separates hair from skin with a flat
 * `luma < 70` cut, chosen because the hair sits at 0x1c1512 against skin near 0xe8d5c0. Lightening
 * the albedo enough for streaks to read pushes lit pixels over that cut, and the metric would report
 * the hair shrinking while the geometry had not moved — the same class of false reading that had
 * a third of the baseline's hair classified as background for many rounds of this work.
 *
 * Varying roughness instead leaves albedo where the metric expects it and still gives the tangent-
 * aligned highlight banding that reads as flow, because `roughnessMap` multiplies the material's
 * roughness by the texture's GREEN channel.
 *
 * The streaks run along V. `buildHeadShell` lays V down the station axis, which is the direction a
 * strand actually grows, so a stripe pattern in U is a set of strands rather than a set of rings.
 * The values are hashed from the column index rather than drawn from `Math.random`, so a capture is
 * reproducible and two runs can be compared.
 */
/**
 * The strand flow, as a tangent-space normal map.
 *
 * Ridges vary across U and hold along V. On the hair mass those axes are polar about the crown — U is
 * the angle round it, V the distance down from it — so a ridge is a strand running out of the whorl.
 * That layout is doing the work: `scripts/tangent-flow-probe.mjs` established that an authored
 * `tangent` attribute does NOT move the pattern (two spheres, same map, one with a whorl tangent
 * field, came out identical), because the shader samples at `vUv` and only orients with the TBN.
 *
 * A normal perturbs the DIFFUSE term, which is why this and not a roughness variation: the hair sits
 * at luma 25.5 to match the reference, and on a surface that dark a change in gloss is invisible
 * while a change in facing is not.
 *
 * Sixteen lanes, not the eleven the roughness map uses at clump scale. Lane count has to be set
 * against the span the UV covers — eleven across a few centimetres of clump rendered as corduroy;
 * here U wraps the whole head.
 *
 * No colour space is set: a normal map is data, and tagging it sRGB would bend the vectors.

  // The front bias is now on BOTH trunk sections and the junction has moved up.
  //
  // The upper section had no `bias` while the lower one had 1.16, so its unbiased spherical cap of radius

  // of the chest was a sphere centred at y 4.487. A sphere split down the middle by the sternum groove is
  // two round halves, which is exactly how it read.
  //
  // 1.28 WAS TOO FAR, AND THE MEASUREMENT SAID SO: it put the chest's z span 10.4% BELOW the reference at
  // y/H 0.271, 12.1% at 0.312 and 7.3% at 0.354. The dome was gone and so was the chest. 1.09 brings the

  // seven chest plates move forward by the same 0.088, or they would carve a surface that has moved out
  // from under them — which is exactly what happened the first time, when flattening left them cutting

  // THE LAT AND SERRATUS CAPSULES ARE DELETED, and the reason is worth keeping.
  //
  // They were added when the trunk was the visible surface: the flank lost 0.180 of half-width between
  // local y 4.46 and 4.20 where the reference loses 0.078, because a capsule interpolates linearly
  // between its ends and cannot carry a mass that swells between them. Four capsules per side fixed it
  // and took x accuracy from 3.91% to 3.45%.
  //
  // The torso shell then took over the flank, and the same capsules became the small bright lump the
  // review kept seeing on both hips. Measuring shell against body slice by slice says it plainly:
  //
  //     local y   shell |x|   body |x|
  //       3.80      0.4940     0.5161   <- body outside by 0.022
  //       3.90      0.5310     0.5397   <- body outside by 0.009
  //
  // The isosurface was standing proud of the surface meant to cover it, so a piece of it appeared past
  // the flank in three-quarter views. There is nothing to tune here — the mass they add is now the
  // shell's job, and any radius large enough to be a lat is large enough to come through.

  // Trapezius. The baseline carries 0.1315 H of width at y/H 0.18 — local 5.10, the base of the
  // neck — where this model carried 0.0962, because it had no trapezius at all: the neck rose as a
  // bare column and the shoulders began as a near-horizontal shelf below it. The reference instead
  // slopes from the deltoid up to the neck, so the flare starts one head-height higher. These two
  // capsules are the slope; the blend radius is deliberately large so they read as one mass with
  // the chest rather than as a pair of struts.
  //
  // The TOP of these caps was the widest thing in the figure's worst band. A capsule's spherical cap
  // reaches `ra` above its axis, so an axis at y 4.96 with ra 0.175 put trapezius 0.315 wide at local
  // y 5.135 — inside the band 5.09..5.35, where the reference is only 0.229 half-wide because its own
  // traps have already tapered. Dropping the axis to 4.89 and the radius to 0.148 puts the cap's top at
  // 5.038, below the band, and leaves the band's width to the neck and the jaw where it belongs.

  // the note above is right that a cap reaching past y 5.09 lands in the neck/jaw band where the
  // reference has already tapered, and that band cost +38.3% once. The outer end goes from x 0.58 to

  // THE NECK HAD NO TAPER. Between local y 5.48 and 5.22 the reference narrows from 0.327 half-wide to
  // 0.229 — the jaw closing into the neck, and the single largest error anywhere on the figure lives in
  // that band: x +38.3%. The model went 0.321 to 0.317, so the neck was as wide as the skull and the head
  // sat on a column instead of on a neck. Radii come down 30% and the trapezius blend from 0.13 to 0.08,
  // because a wide smooth union with the traps was inflating whatever the neck's own radius said.
  //
  // 0.153/0.120 OVERSHOT. That band went from +38.3% to -19.7% — the trunk's top cap was the thing
  // making it wide, and once that was lowered the neck was carrying the band alone and was far too thin
  // for it. 0.190/0.156 is sized against the reference's own 0.229 half-width there.
  // (deleted — the field's neck column; the `Neck` lathe is the neck, see the note above)
  // THE RIB CREASES ARE GONE. They were two carves running the full width of the chest at y 4.09 and
  // y 4.27, and the second of them sat inside the pec band — a full-width horizontal groove across the
  // centre of the chest, which is precisely what a chest must not have. They were authored as rib lines
  // and they read as a shelf, because a horizontal cut across a rounded front reads as a shelf whatever
  // it was meant to be. Nothing replaces them: rib definition on this reference lives in the abdominal
  // bands lower down, which are additive planes, not grooves.
  // THE CHEST IS CUT BY PLATES, NOT BUILT FROM BLOBS.
  //
  // The old pectorals were two flattened capsules unioned onto the trunk, and the old sternum and
  // lower-pec boundaries were capsule carves. Both had the same problem: a capsule's surface is an
  // ellipsoidal cap, so a pec made of them is a mound and a boundary made of them is a rounded gutter.
  // Neither can produce the thing the reference has, which is a change of PLANE.
  //
  // The carves had also stopped working. They were seated for a chest whose front reached z 0.411, and
  // flattening the dome brought it to 0.298 — the sternum carve's near face sat at 0.358 and the lower
  // pec's at 0.271, both in front of the skin, cutting nothing at all. Anything re-seated here has its
  // depth quoted against the measured surface rather than inherited.
  //
  // Each plate is an oriented rounded box used as a carve, positioned so its flat BACK face lands on the
  // surface it defines: the box swallows everything in front of that plane inside its own bounds, and
  // what survives is the plane. A plate's `pitch` tilts it about x, so the plane it leaves tilts with it.
  //
  // Depth targets come from the GLB's own cross-sections: at local y 4.40 the reference's chest front is
  // at z 0.287 and its half-width 0.696; at y 4.15, z 0.275.

  // STERNUM. A shallow vertical plane, not a trench: it takes the surface from 0.298 back to 0.280, so
  // 0.018 deep. Width is 2 x (0.018 + 0.010) = 0.056, which is 4% of the 1.40 chest width — the top of
  // the 2-4% the brief allows. It stops at y 4.62 so the upper sternum stays flat.

  // LOWER-PEC CUT. A plane that tilts back going down, so the chest tucks under the pec instead of
  // hanging below it. The plane is z = 0.272 + 0.309 (y - 4.25): no cut at all at y 4.40, 0.05 of cut by
  // y 4.10. Angled down toward the sternum because the plate is centred at x = +/-0.34 and its own width
  // runs out before the centre line, so the cut is deepest outboard and fades inboard — the chevron the
  // reference has, made as a plane change rather than as a groove.
  //
  // The first seating of this plate cut 0.003 at y 4.15 and nothing at 4.28 — the ribcage already tapers
  // there, so a plane laid ON the taper removes nothing and shows nothing. The plane now runs
  // z = 0.255 + 0.40 (y - 4.28): 0.026 of cut at the boundary, 0.041 by y 4.15, and still clear of the

  // PECTORALS, as two flat heads rather than one blob or one box.
  //
  // The chest had NO pec mass at all after the dome was removed, and the measurement says so as plainly
  // as the eye does: the reference's chest front sits at local z 0.285 at y 4.46, 0.279 at 4.20 and 0.256
  // at 3.95, and the model reached 0.251, 0.222 and 0.186 — behind by 0.034, 0.057 and 0.070 across the
  // whole pec. Total depth was only 3-7% short, so the shortfall was not size, it was that the ribcage's
  // z CENTRE sat 0.021 too far back and nothing stood in front of it. A chest without a pectoralis is a
  // ribcage, and it reads as one.
  //
  // Two heads, because a pectoralis has two and because that is what puts a plane break across the middle
  // of the muscle instead of a single dome over it:
  //   sternal head   — from the sternum out and slightly UP to the humerus, the larger mass, and the one
  //                    the lower-pec plate cuts along its bottom edge
  //   clavicular head — from the collarbone out and slightly DOWN, thinner, sitting proud of the first
  //
  // Each is a capsule squashed hard on z (2.6 and 2.8) so it is a SLAB, and moderately on y so it is
  // wider than it is tall — the fibre direction of the muscle. `exact` keeps their radii literal: the
  // 0.84 global scale exists to compensate for blend inflation on the inherited ring stack, and these are
  // authored against measurements, not inherited.
  //
  // They protrude 0.020 past the ribcage at the sternum and fade to nothing at the armpit, which is the
  // whole of the projection a flat male chest has. The definition comes from the four cuts around them.

  // THE CHEST IS CARVED OUT OF A FULL RIBCAGE, NOT BUILT UP FROM PLATES.
  //
  // Three representations were tried here and the first two failed for the same reason, which is worth
  // recording so it is not tried a fourth time.
  //
  //   capsules            a capsule's surface is an ellipsoidal cap, so a pec made of one is a
  //                       hemisphere and the pair read as two spheres with a groove between them
  //   plates, ADDED       a plate's face is planar, but to show a plane the face must stand proud of
  //                       the shell — and then all FOUR of its edges stand proud too, so the chest read
  //                       as rectangular slabs laid on the torso. Raising the blend to hide the unwanted
  //                       edges (k 0.05 -> 0.115) erased the wanted ones with them: a smooth union
  //                       blurs a primitive's whole outline and cannot keep one edge while losing
  //                       another. Enlarging the plates so the unwanted edges would sink into the
  //                       shoulder and flank did not help either, because a face that stands 0.06 proud
  //                       stands proud in every direction.
  //
  // So the chest is CARVED. The trunk's front bias goes from 1.09 to 0.96, which fills the ribcage out
  // past the reference on purpose, and the planes are cut back into it. A carving plate's other three
  // edges lie inside solid material where nothing can see them; only the cut face reaches the surface.
  // This is how the sternum, lower-pec, clavicle and armpit cuts have always worked here — they never
  // produced a box — and the mistake was trying to make the pec MASS the same way.
  //
  // Faces are seated on the measured skin of the filled ribcage, not on arithmetic:
  //
  //   sternum       a 0.070 strip at z 0.372, 0.021 behind the pec faces — 5% of the 1.40 chest, and
  //                 shallow enough that it cannot throw the dark vertical line the brief forbids
  //   upper pec     pitched back 0.40 so the chest falls away toward the collarbone; this is the
  //                 upper-chest shelf and the clavicle plane in one plane change rather than a groove
  //   lower pec     pitched forward 0.34 so the chest tucks under, rolled 0.10 so its lower edge runs
  //                 level outboard and dips toward the sternum — the shallow chevron

  // The arm chain begins at x 0.82 with a radius of 0.228, so the shoulder was whatever the smooth union
  // of that capsule and the trunk happened to produce: a joint, not a muscle. Measured skin at x 0.90 was
  // 0.206 half-tall against the arm's own 0.163 at x 1.20 — a 26% swell, where a deltoid should read as
  // roughly half again the arm it covers.
  //
  // The cap is one capsule biased DOWN and out. `bias` divides the offset on the positive side, so a value
  // BELOW one makes it fuller ABOVE — and 0.82 did exactly that, putting a band of model-only pixels along
  // the top of both shoulders in the silhouette overlay while the reference's shoulder slopes away. 1.24
  // pulls the mass under the acromion, where a deltoid actually sits: hanging from the joint rather than
  // piling on top of it and squashed so it is wider than deep. It starts inboard of
  // the arm root at x 0.72 so it grows out of the torso rather than sitting on it, and dies at x 1.22
  // where the biceps takes over.

  // THE Z SQUASH WAS INVERTED. It was 0.836 on the thigh and 0.884 on the shin, and squash DIVIDES the
  // extent, so a value below 1 makes the limb DEEPER than its radius — the thigh measured 0.385 half-deep
  // against 0.287 half-wide. A thigh is wider than it is deep, and the GLB's own cross-sections say so:
  // half-depth 0.283 at local y 2.67, 0.282 at 2.42, 0.283 at 2.17, against the model's 0.385, 0.354 and
  // 0.321 — 36%, 25% and 13% over. This was the largest single error anywhere in the figure.

  // 1.15, 0.89 and 0.64 from +3.1%, 0.0% and -1.8% to -18.9%, -18.1% and -19.2%: they were already right,
  // and the +17% that looked like a shin error at y 1.40 belongs to the thigh capsule, which runs down to
  // 1.45. Two changes at once hid that for one round.
  //
  // 1.10 comes from those measurements, not from taste. The reference's thigh depth barely tapers
  // over that range while a capsule's radius does, so the fit is not exact: the residual runs -1% at 2.67

  // INNER-THIGH SLIT. The figure forked at y/H 0.627 against the reference's 0.5241 — 0.103 H too
  // low — and the cause was a primitive, not a parameter: the seat capsule is centred on x = 0 with
  // radius 0.600, so its spherical lower cap hangs to y 2.18 and fills the whole space between the
  // thighs. Nothing about the thighs could open a gap the trunk was busy closing.
  //
  // The profile is measured off the baseline render rather than chosen — gap width in figure heights
  // by height: 0.0040 at y/H 0.530, 0.0080 at 0.545, 0.0120 at 0.570, 0.0161 at 0.580, then a pinch
  // to 0.0110 at 0.600 before opening to 0.0251 at 0.620 and 0.0402 at 0.650. Two segments carry the
  // envelope; the pinch is one fold and is not modelled here.
  //
  // squash z of 0.055 is what makes this a SLAB rather than a rod. A rod of radius 0.03 removes
  // material 0.03 deep in z, which leaves the front and back of the crotch intact and the slit
  // invisible from the front — the gap has to cut clean through to show up in a silhouette at all.
  // The radii are the THIGHS' OWN inner edges, read off their capsules rather than chosen: thigh L
  // has axis x -0.31 radius 0.31 with squash x 1.08, so its x half-extent at height y is
  // sqrt(0.31^2 - (2.70 - y)^2) / 1.08 and its inner edge is 0.31 minus that — 0.091 at y 2.90,
  // 0.038 at 2.80, 0.023 at 2.70 where it pinches, 0.057 at 2.40, 0.085 at 2.16. An hourglass, and
  // within 0.01 of the baseline's measured gap through the middle of its length.
  //
  // A first attempt used 0.016 rising to 0.050 and moved the fork by 0.0155 H against the 0.103 H
  // error. It was not too weak, it was aimed wrong: a carve NARROWER than the space the thighs
  // already leave removes nothing that was not going to be gap anyway, and leaves the seat capsule's
  // web on either side of it. What has to be removed is the seat's material out to the thigh, so the
  // carve has to be as wide as the thigh's inner edge, which is 4 to 6 times wider.
  // The two capsules that cut this slit live in CROTCH_SLIT below rather than here, because the garment
  // needs to evaluate the body BOTH ways: with the slit, to wrap each leg, and without it, to know where
  // the front and back of the crotch are. See `bodyFieldNoSlit`.
  // Feet in the field: the wedge was a separate mesh capped at the ankle, which is the discrete
  // joint the reference does not have. Flattened on y (flat sole), tapering heel to toe.
  // THE FOOT WEDGE IS GONE FROM THE FIELD. An explicit foot shell now owns this region, and leaving the
  // capsule in place meant the shell was rendering INSIDE it — the region score read 0.96 while the
  // profile render was unchanged, because it was scoring the capsule. A number that good next to a
  // picture that has not moved is the signature of measuring the wrong object.
  //
  // The ankle capsules below still reach down to y 0.14, which is inside the shell, so the leg still
  // meets the foot through a shared volume rather than a butt joint.
  // THE TEN TOE STUBS ARE GONE, and they were never visible. Each was 0.040 in radius with a y squash of
  // 1.9, so 0.080 across in x and 0.042 in y against a grid of dx 0.0317 and dy 0.0410 — 2.5 samples wide
  // and ONE sample tall, against a floor of about three. They could not be polygonised at any radius that
  // still looked like a toe, and the render shows what that produced: a smooth hoof with no toes at all.
  // Toes are explicit lofts now, next to the hands, for exactly the reason the fingers are.
  // Ankles reach down into the foot wedge so the two overlap; without this the shin ends in a
  // cap and the foot starts in another, which is the discrete joint the reference does not have.
  //
  // The ankle now LEANS FORWARD. At local y 0.382 the reference spans z -0.239..0.207 and the model
  // spanned -0.275..0.043: the back was right and the front was missing 0.164, which is an instep. An
  // ankle whose axis runs from z -0.10 down to -0.03 has none; running it from -0.055 to +0.02 with a
  // shallower z squash puts the front of the band at 0.174.

/**
 * The shorts as ONE surface: pelvis, crotch and both legs, sharing their vertices.
 *
 * WHY THE EIGHT-COMPONENT VERSION COULD NOT BE FIXED BY NUMBERS. Each component was an independent
 * closed ring, so neighbours could only overlap, never join. Where the pelvis panel met a leg tube the
 * two boundaries differed by 0.09 in depth at the same point in space — the panel's ellipse is
 * 0.653 half-wide and still at 0.973 of full depth by x = 0.15, while the tube's is 0.249 half-wide
 * and already down to 0.643 of its own — and the body showed through the step. Two ellipses of
 * different curvature cannot be made to agree along a curve by choosing better radii. They have to
 * share the curve.
 *
 * THE TOPOLOGY. A tube that splits into two tubes, which is how a real pattern does it:
 *
 *   - the pelvis is a closed ring of N vertices swept down from the waist to the crotch row;
 *   - at the crotch row, index 0 is the front rise (x = 0, front) and index N/2 the back rise;
 *   - a SEAM CHAIN of interior vertices runs front rise -> back rise at x = 0, dipping below the
 *     crotch row to give the gusset its saddle;
 *   - the right leg's first ring is the ring's right arc PLUS the chain; the left leg's is the left
 *     arc plus the SAME chain vertices, traversed the other way.
 *
 * So the gusset is not a patch laid over a gap — it is the neighbourhood of the seam, bounded on four
 * sides by the front rise, the right inner leg root, the back rise and the left inner leg root. Every
 * chain edge carries one face from each leg, so it is interior, not boundary. The only open edges in
 * the whole surface are the waist and the two hems: three loops, by construction rather than by
 * inspection.
 *
 * Ring angles for the legs are read off the crotch ring itself rather than spaced evenly, so the
 * composite ring's uneven spacing — dense on the inner side where the chain is — is carried down the
 * leg instead of being resampled and torn.

   * because a body does not become thigh-shaped in 0.025 of height — while the ring there is already
   * a thigh ellipse and puts cloth at z 0.147, a fifth of a unit inside. The vertex needed to travel
   * 0.20 forward and was allowed 0.05, so the crotch leaked from the front.
   *
   * The real constraint was never a distance. It is that cloth must not cross to the other leg. So the

 * field's gradient, so "hard crease here, smooth there" is not expressible at all. Large planes met at
 * intentional edges is exactly what the reference's low-poly language is made of, and a smooth union
 * of primitives cannot produce it at any parameter setting.
 *
 * So the torso's front and back are authored as sections with named control points, quads are run
 * between consecutive stations, and the material is flat-shaded: each quad becomes a plane, and every
 * edge between two stations or two control points is a crease that was put there on purpose.
 *
 * `hug` guarantees the shell stays outside the body field it covers — the same march the shorts use —
 * so the underlying isosurface can never show through a station that was authored too tight.

 *

 * read. The threshold is the only control, and it names the thing it controls: how sharp a turn has to

 * closed lofts that only overlapped. Two things follow from that and no parameter changes either:
 *
 *   - the palm ends in a ring perpendicular to its own axis, which is a STRAIGHT EDGE. The knuckle fan
 *     is a staggered edge, so however carefully the finger roots were set back, the boundary the eye
 *     sees was flat;
 *   - webbing has to be continuous with both the palm and the fingers. Three separate web patches were
 *     built at three sizes and every one rendered as a tooth, because a separate loft in a 0.038 gap has
 *     a silhouette of its own.
 *
 * Here the palm's distal ring is authored as a strip — nine vertices across the back of the hand and
 * nine across the palm — and each finger takes THREE of the back and THREE of the palm as its own first
 * ring. Neighbouring fingers share the vertex between them, so:
 *
 *   - the boundary between palm and fingers is wherever each finger's first ring is placed, which is
 *     the fan, expressed as geometry rather than approximated by setback;
 *   - the shared vertex IS the web. It cannot be a tooth because it is not a separate object.

  // same physical material minus that one term rather than a silently wrong highlight.

  // neck/shoulder region scored 0.549 in profile against 0.83 from the front — a placement error,
  // not a shape one. Seating it back over the spine fixes both halves of that band at once.
  // THE NECK WAS SHALLOW, NOT NARROW. Measured against the reference at local y 5.22 it was 0.246 half-
  // wide against 0.230 — correct, even slightly over — and 0.277 half-DEEP against 0.342, short by 19%.
  // At 5.08 it was 0.266 against about 0.337, short by 21%. A neck that is the right width and a fifth
  // too thin reads as a flat plate from any three-quarter angle, which is what "the neck looks small and
  // narrow" was pointing at: the eye reads the volume, and the volume was missing in z.
  //
  // Ring z values are divided by the 0.924 that facetedBody's 22.5-degree vertex placement costs, so
  // 0.370 delivers 0.342.
  //
  // The LOWEST ring keeps 0.345 rather than joining the others at 0.40: it sits at the shoulder, not in
  // the neck, and deepening it took the band at local y 4.71 to +8.2% on z. Depth belongs to the column,
  // not to where the column meets the trapezius.
  //
  // THE TOP RING FLARES rather than tapering. At local y 5.22 the reference is 0.229 half-wide and
  // 0.343 half-deep — that band is the angle of the JAW, not the column of the neck, and the widest
  // thing in it was this lathe at 0.185 / 0.283. The band measured -19.7% and -17.4%.
  //
  // Widening the trunk's neck capsule did nothing, because this mesh is what occupies the band: the
  // capsule is inside it. A ring value is not the half-width either — facetedBody puts vertices at
  // 22.5 degrees, so the widest reaches 0.924 of the radius. 0.266 x 0.924 lands on 0.229.
  //
  // A straight capsule scored 10.1% missing AND 10.3% extra in the same profile band — the mark
  // of a wrong shape rather than a wrong size, which no amount of moving or scaling fixes. The
  // baseline's neck is not a column: it flares into the trapezius at the base and the column
  // itself sits back over the spine, rising slightly forward toward the skull. Rings with a
  // per-ring z offset reproduce both, where the capsule could reproduce neither.
  // HEAD AND NECK — ONE STATIONED SHELL, replacing two lathes.
  //
  // Both were `facetedBody`, a surface of revolution, so every section was a scaled n-gon centred on the
  // axis. That is why the jaw, the chin, the temple hollow and the cranial profile could never be built:
  // none of them is radially symmetric, and no amount of ring tuning changes that. It is also why the
  // two could only ever MEET — welded to 0.00000 and still reading as a join, because a weld pins
  // positions while normals, shading and topology stay separate.
  //
  // Eleven stations run from the lower neck to the crown as one indexed surface. `frontDepth` and
  // `backDepth` are separate per station, so the receding forehead and the full occiput come from the
  // SHAPE of each ring — the axis stays vertical at zCentre -0.185 all the way up, which is what
  // "straight with the neck" means. Shearing the axis to fake those is what made the side view a
  // parallelogram.
  //
  // `shape` is where the anatomy that a lathe cannot hold lives: at the jaw it pulls the gonion out at
  // ring indices 3-5 and 11-13 while drawing the chin in at 0-2, so the section stops being an oval
  // without the ring ceasing to be low-poly.
  // THE V IS AT THE JAW AND CHIN, WHICH IS WHERE THE MEASUREMENT PUT IT. Width per level in the front
  // view, normalised by the widest part of the cranium, model over baseline:
  //     cranium 1.046 · temple 1.039 · cheekbone 1.091 · cheek-low 1.064 · jaw 1.388 · chin 1.478
  // The upper face was only 4-9% wide; the jaw was 39% and the chin 48%. Narrowing everything evenly
  // would have shrunk a face that was nearly right at the top and still left it square at the bottom,
  // so the correction is graded: chin and jaw hard, cheek and cheekbone lightly, temple untouched.

  // baseline's profile front edge sits at 0.0886 H while a straight lathe put this head's at 0.0436:
  // a 0.045 H overhang, and the largest single edge error left on the figure. The reference recedes
  // there because the jaw runs back toward the ear rather than dropping vertically.
  //
  // Both parts of the shape are load-bearing. Pulling the jaw back with zOffset alone (-0.28/-0.14)
  // fixed y/H 0.16 but pushed the BACK edge out 0.0193 H at the same row and moved the chin above
  // y/H 0.14, where the reference still projects — net loss. So the recess is cut by SHRINKING the
  // radius with only a small offset, which leaves the back edge within 0.001 of where it was, and
  // ring 5.36 is added to hold the chin point at the height the baseline puts it.
    // THE JAW HAD NO FRONT. At local y 5.22 the reference spans z -0.368..+0.316 and the model spanned
  // -0.352..+0.073: the BACK of the head matched to 0.016 and the front was missing 0.243. That is the
  // chin and the jaw, and it is where the -36% depth error in the figure's worst band came from. At the
  // cheek band above it the two already agree — ref front 0.409, model 0.395 — so nothing above y 5.36
  // changes.
  //
  // The four LOW rings gain depth: the bands at local y 5.48 and 5.22 measured -10.3% and -9.4% on z
  // while 5.73 and 5.99 were already +4.7% and +6.8%, so the deficit is the jaw and cheek, not the
  // skull. Only the rings below 5.60 change.
  //
  // The CHEEK rings widen too, and that is a correction to a compensation. Tucking the ears against the
  // skull took the band at local y 5.48 from -1.8% to -16.9% on width — which means the ears had been
  // carrying the head's width there, standing off a skull too narrow to reach the reference's 0.654 on
  // its own. A feature propping up a proportion is a bug in both.
  //
  // The ring value is not the half-width either. `facetedBody` places vertices at 22.5 degrees and every
  // 45 after, so none sits at 0 or 90 and the widest reaches cos(22.5) = 0.924 of the radius; the head
  // then carries HEAD_X = 0.916 on top. A ring of 0.352 delivers 0.298, which is why widening it from
  // 0.300 moved the band one and a half points instead of fifteen. 0.386 x 0.924 x 0.916 = 0.327, the
  // reference's own half-width there.
  //
  // The two lower rings gain depth and move FORWARD: the old z offsets of -0.11 and -0.078 pulled the
  // jaw back under the skull, which is what made the face read as a flat wedge with no chin in profile.
  // Face features, rebuilt against a 4x zoom crop of the baseline's head rather than the 64x64

  // was wrong in kind, not degree: a four-sided cone standing off the face as a pyramid where the

  // shape, and ears as round pads floating clear of the skull at cheek height.

  // (5.37) and `neck-mid` (5.53) for a y of 5.5 — the collapsed station with negative depths. Every
  // facial feature anchored through here was therefore placed inside the head, which is why the face
  // rendered completely blank.
  //
  // Sorting a COPY for the lookup fixes that and touches no geometry: the mesh still stitches the
  // array in its authored order.
  // DEGENERATE STATIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE LOOKUP, not just sorted into it.

  // HAIR: a scalp cap plus one shaped mass, terminated at an authored boundary.
  //
  // An earlier generation of this section described a cap plus crown, fringe, three locks, two temple
  // masses, a spike and a nape mass. None of them exist: eight kinds of added detail geometry were
  // built and measured over this work and every one was removed, because the four-view reference has
  // no lock separation in its silhouette from any angle. What it has is a hard angular boundary and a
  // fine flow striation, and those are what `buildHairMass` and the flow normal map provide.
  //
  // What DOES carry over from that generation, because it was structural rather than stylistic:
  // `facetedBody` is a surface of revolution, so an asymmetric hairline is not expressible in it at
  // all. That is why the head and the hair are both stationed shells.
  //
  // Two meshes:
  //   hair-cap    thin, derived from the skull's own stations, its only job being that no skin shows.
  //               It must never be on the silhouette, which is what lets the mass be shaped freely.
  //   hair-mass   the silhouette, with its own per-column boundary and its own column resolution.
  // HUG THE SKULL. Measured: hair area over head area in the FRONT view is 0.418 here against the
  // reference's 0.306, so the mass carries 37% more than it should; in profile 0.631 against 0.575,

  // THE MAIN SHELL. One surface, three openings. The eight-component assembly this replaces is gone
  // entirely — no waistband ring, no half-shell panels, no gusset strip, no leg tubes, no hem bands —
  // because its failure was that its components could only be placed next to one another. The horizontal
  // gap between pelvis and legs, the two skin wings beside the crotch and the narrow hanging gusset were
  // all the same defect: unjoined boundaries. Waistband, hem, seams and folds come back only after this
  // is closed.
  //
  // Pelvis rings, local. Widths and depths are the measured body plus clearance and are a floor only;
  // `hug` sets what ships. Front and back depth differ by 0.020, which is as much asymmetry as this
  // figure's own seat supports.
  // ON CLEARANCE, AND ON A THEORY THAT WAS WRONG.
  //
  // The relaxation pass drove the worst geometric shortfall to 0.0121 — every vertex, edge midpoint and
  // triangle centroid outside the body field — and the crotch still leaked. I concluded the field was not
  // what renders, since a surface-nets triangle can sit up to half a cell from the field's zero level and
  // half this grid's cell diagonal is 0.0294, larger than the clearance. So I raised clearance to 0.046.
  // The leak did not move. The theory was plausible, checkable and false, and running the check is the
  // only reason it did not become a permanent doubling of the garment's offset.
  //
  // The actual cause was a leftover mesh in the crotch that `bodyField` knows nothing about. With that
  // deleted, clearance is back to 0.022 — which is what it should be, because the outer rings are authored
  // as the thigh plus clearance and `hug` only pushes outward, so this number sets the garment's width
  // directly. The measured band width was already right at 0.022.
