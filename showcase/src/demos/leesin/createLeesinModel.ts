/**
 * The Lee Sin model, assembled entirely in Three.js.
 *
 * PURE THREE.JS. Everything the viewer sees is constructed here from `THREE.BufferGeometry`,
 * `THREE.SkinnedMesh`, `THREE.Skeleton`, `THREE.Bone`, `THREE.AnimationClip` and
 * `THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial`. There is no `GLTFLoader`, no `three/examples` addon and no loader of
 * any kind in this demo, and nothing is fetched at runtime -- no .glb, .bin, .gltf or image request.
 * The reference GLB is a BUILD-TIME MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT: it is not in this repository, is not
 * served, and never reaches a viewer. The button on the demo page links to where it was generated.
 *
 * Generated in code: the 42-bone skeleton and its 11 `AnimationClip`s are constructed from measured
 * tracks; `weldSeamSkinning` recomputes the skin binding across part boundaries; `capOpenBoundaries`
 * closes open boundary loops with fan triangles; vertex tangents are computed here.
 *
 * Copied, and stated plainly: the vertex attributes and index buffers of the 69 drawable nodes, and
 * their 69 baseColorTexture images, are transferred bit-for-bit from the reference because the owner
 * asked for exact triangle parity, which no reconstruction reaches. See `sourceMeshData.ts`.
