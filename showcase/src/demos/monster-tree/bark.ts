/**
 * The bark surface: grain, relief, cavity shading, moss, and the sap veins running under it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The playground export drops the source normal map — `object-sculpt-spec`
 * records it as "source had a normal map; NOT carried (vertex normals only)". So the figure
 * arrives as 115,350 triangles of smooth shading with the bark painted on in vertex colour: the
 * silhouette is a tree, but every surface between the silhouettes is soft, and the deep vertical
 * grain that is most of what makes the reference read as wood is simply gone. No amount of
 * lighting recovers detail that is not in the surface. This module puts the relief back
 * procedurally.
 *
 * THE GRAIN FOLLOWS THE ANATOMY, and that is the part worth reading twice.
 *
 * Real wood grain runs along the limb it grew in. A single vertical noise field gives a figure that
 * looks like it was carved out of one plank — the forearms get horizontal banding, the shoulders
 * get grain running across them. So the grain direction is a per-vertex attribute taken from the
 * rig: each vertex's dominant bone contributes its own bind-space axis, measured bone-to-child
 * (see `grainDirections` in `rig.ts`). Measured on this skeleton, that gives
 *
 *     L_Forearm   [ 0.00,  0.00, -1.00]   along the arm
 *     R_Forearm   [ 0.30,  0.00,  0.95]   along the arm
 *     L_Thigh     [-0.09, -0.99, -0.11]   down the leg
 *     Spine02     [-0.02,  0.96, -0.29]   up the torso
 *
 * The noise coordinate is then squashed along that axis and stretched across it, so features
 * elongate into fibres running the length of each limb. The arms read as arms, the thighs as
 * thighs — the wood becomes body parts rather than a texture wrapped over a body.
 *
 * Everything is sampled in BIND-POSE space (`position`, `normal` — the raw attributes, before
 * skinning). Sample the skinned or world position instead and the grain, the moss and the veins
 * all swim across the surface the instant a clip runs, which reads as the bark flowing past the
 * character rather than being part of them.
