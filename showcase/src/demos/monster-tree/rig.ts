 * Branch stock lifted out of the character's own upper body.
 *

 * tapered cylinders, which gave the right proportions and the wrong shape: smooth, round, and
 * nothing like the gnarled forms the figure is actually made of. This takes the geometry instead
 * of imitating it.
 *
 * The source is the CROWN, above y 0.90 — the thin dry twigs over the skull. Measured by slicing
 * the crown into horizontal slabs and sizing each twig's cross-section, they run 0.0140 radius at
 * the base down to 0.0038 at the tips: genuinely slender dead wood, tapering to about a quarter of
 * its base.
 *
 * The shoulder spur cluster was tried first and was wrong. It is a real branch off the torso, but
 * extracting it drags a lump of shoulder mass along with it, and 2,526 triangles of body wall
 * instanced on a trunk reads as a slab, not a twig. Thinness is what makes wood read as a branch,
 * and the shoulder had none to give.
 *
 * Normalised to unit height with its base at the origin, so an instance is placed by scale and
 * rotation alone.

 * belongs to. That is what makes the wood read as body parts instead of one carved plank.
 *
 * Two details:

 * Scale is FIXED at the rig's normalise scale rather than solved for. Solving it lets the piece
 * breathe with the skin — the best-fit scale swings about 8% over a punch, because linear blend
 * skinning really does compress the inside of a bent elbow — and a leather bracer that shrinks
 * and swells is the very deformation this split exists to remove. Fixing it costs almost nothing
 * in tracking (bracer-l 0.0532 solved vs 0.0537 fixed) and makes the piece rigid by construction:
 * one rotation, one translation, one constant scale, so no two vertices in the piece can change
 * their distance at all.

 * Build the figure: one skinned bark shell, four rigid leather pieces, a skeleton, and every clip.

 *
 * three composes a skinned vertex as
 *
 *     world = meshWorld * bindMatrixInverse * (boneWorld * boneInverse) * bindMatrix * v
 *
 * and, in the default `AttachedBindMode`, it recomputes `bindMatrixInverse = meshWorld^-1` every
 * frame. So `meshWorld` cancels itself out and the whole expression collapses to
 *
 *     world = boneWorld * boneInverse * bindMatrix * v
 *
 * The skin follows the SKELETON's place in the scene graph, not the mesh's. Hence: the normalise
 * scale goes on a group ABOVE THE BONES (`skinRoot`), where it lands in `boneWorld` and is applied
 * once. (Putting it on the SkinnedMesh instead, as the export does, happens to survive — the stale
 * `bindMatrix` captured before the scale is cancelled by the `bindMatrixInverse` three refreshes
 * each frame. `tools/measure-rig.mjs` gate R0 measures the export at 1.0x, not 2x. Relying on that
 * cancellation is still worth avoiding: it makes the scale invisible in the expression that
 * actually drives the skin.)
 *
 * `bind()` IS called with an explicit identity bind matrix, and that one is not cosmetic. Called
 * without one, three runs `skeleton.calculateInverses()`, which discards the GLB's authored
 * `inverseBind` matrices that `buildSkeleton` just passed in and re-derives them from the bones'
 * current rest pose. Those are not the same matrices here: this rig's authored bind pose sits a
 * uniform 4.43e-3 rig units (8.8 mm after the normalise scale) off its node rest pose on every
 * one of the 41 bones, so the export silently skins the figure against a bind pose the GLB does
 * not declare.

   * THE MIXER DOES NOT ALWAYS WRITE BACK, and everything below depends on knowing that.
   *
   * `PropertyMixer.apply` compares the value it accumulated against the snapshot it took and
   * writes to the scene graph ONLY if the two differ. Every clip in this rig carries a scale track
   * for all 41 bones and every one of those tracks is a constant 1, so for scale the mixer decides
   * nothing has changed and never writes at all. Anything that modifies a bone in place is
   * therefore never reset, and it compounds: measured on the authored log barrage,
   * `L_Forearm.scale.y` reached **106,195** inside a 2.3-second move and threw the hand hundreds of
   * units out of the world. It had survived this long only because the shipped presets vary their
   * scale enough to keep the mixer writing.
   *
   * The same is true of rotation, which is why a partial-weight aim is impossible without this: a
   * weighted slerp from the live quaternion reads its own previous output and converges to full
   * weight inside two frames.
   *
   * So both systems below record what they found and what they left, restore the first before
   * computing anything, and write each bone exactly once. The equality test on restore keeps it
   * honest in the other direction — if the mixer DID write something new it will not match what we
   * left there, and we leave it alone.
