/**
 * Authored gestures for Groot's living-wood kit.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST. The rig ships sixteen clips from Tripo's generic biped library — boxing rounds,
 * front kicks, six dances. They are real motion and they are measured honestly elsewhere in this
 * demo, but none of them is the motion of a treant throwing a vine, calling wood down, or rooting
 * itself into the ground. Borrowing `box_01` for Heartwood Lash gives a boxer's jab with a vine drawn on
 * it, and no amount of effect work fixes a body doing the wrong thing.
 *
 * So the public kit is POSED here rather than borrowed. Each move is a timeline of aim
 * directions, one per bone, blended with smoothstep and solved onto the skeleton by
 * `rig.aim` / `rig.applyPose`. Underneath, the body still plays a trimmed copy of
 * `standing_relax` — the quietest clip in the library — so the torso keeps breathing and the
 * weight keeps shifting without any of that having to be hand-authored.
 *
 * THE FRAME, measured not assumed (see `model.ts`): the figure faces **+X**, up is **+Y**, and its
 * own left is **-Z**. At rest its arms run straight out along ±Z, so pointing one forward is a
 * ninety-degree swing at the shoulder.
 *
 * THE BEATS ARE AUTHORED. Everything else in this showcase schedules against `events.ts`, a sweep
 * of the shipped clips at 240 Hz. That table describes clips nobody here wrote. For these four the
 * relationship is inverted: the gesture is designed around when the hand should stop, and the
 * skill's cues use the same numbers. `BEATS` below is that contract, in one place, so the pose and
 * the effect cannot drift apart.

 * A leg, bent by `deg` MORE than it rests — never less, and with the foot kept under the hip.

 * down — the foot went 8 cm through the floor at the deepest frame of the former lash. Deriving both
 * segments from the measured rest with a bend that only ever adds makes that impossible.
 *
 * And the calf angle is SOLVED, not chosen. Given a thigh of 0.395 tilted forward by `a`, the knee
 * moves forward by 0.395·sin(a), and the calf of 0.473 has to come back by asin(0.395·sin(a)/0.473)
