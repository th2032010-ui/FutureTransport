/**
 * Phân Thân — the split-body: five copies of the figure, each standing at its own frame of the
 * same clip.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THESE COPIES AND NOT INSTANCES. Every echo is a real `THREE.SkinnedMesh` over the
 * character's own 101,466-triangle geometry, driven by its own skeleton and its own
 * `AnimationMixer` (see `MonsterTreeRig.makeEcho`). Nothing about the silhouette is approximated:
 * an echo is the character, posed elsewhere in time. Only the bones are duplicated — five copies
 * of ~60 bones against one shared vertex buffer.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE LAGGED. Locked to the original's playhead, five copies hold one pose in five
 * places and the eye reads a mirror artifact rather than five bodies. Each echo runs the clip a
 * fixed interval BEHIND, so on any frame the fan shows the whole strike sequence at once — the
 * nearest copy where the original was 80 ms ago, the furthest where it was 400 ms ago. That is an
 * afterimage, and it is only possible because each copy owns a skeleton.
 *
 * WHERE THE BEATS COME FROM. Each echo is committed to one measured arrest in `dance_05` — the
 * densest strike sequence in the clip library, 18 arrests in 2.333 s — chosen one per window by
 * `beats()` so they cannot cluster. An echo flares and lands its blow when ITS OWN playhead
 * crosses its arrest, which is its beat plus its own lag. Nothing here is hand-timed.

 * other effect in this showcase sits somewhere on the green-through-bark ramp, which is right for
