/**
 * Effects for the monster-tree showcase.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: hand-written plain-Three.js. The img2threejs skill has no particle subsystem, no
 * trail subsystem and no shader library, so every effect below — the spore field, the eye glow,
 * the palm trails, the ground rings, the chest core, the bursts — was written for this demo. No
 * dependency is added; everything is `THREE.Points`, `THREE.Mesh`, a `ShaderMaterial`, or a
 * texture painted into a `<canvas>` at build time.
 *
 * WHERE THINGS GO: every effect is anchored to a socket or a bone that actually exists on the rig
 * — `rig.sockets['eye-l']`, `rig.bones['R_ToeBase']` — and the sockets themselves are measured
 * centroids of real vertex clusters (see `measured.ts`). There are no magic coordinates in this
 * file. The only literals are radii, counts and durations, which are effect parameters rather than
 * placements.
 *
 * WHAT COLOUR THINGS ARE: everything emissive is built from `LIFE_HUE`, the hue measured off the
 * character's own iris in the reference photograph (82.5 degrees). Saturation and lightness are
 * pushed past the measured values because an emissive channel has to out-run the albedo it sits
 * on, but the hue never moves. Bark and moss tints come from `PALETTE`, also measured.
 */

/**
 * Eye halo diameter as a fraction of figure height. Small: an additively blended sprite saturates
