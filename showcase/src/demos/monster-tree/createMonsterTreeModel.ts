/**
 * Groot — a rigged Flora Colossus rebuilt from one photograph.
 *
 * Gallery entry point. Everything substantive lives in the modules beside this file; this one
 * adapts them to the showcase's contracts — `userData.tick(dt, elapsed)` for the frame loop and
 * `userData.sculptRuntime.animationController` for the Animations panel.
 *
 * Current motion/rig/VFX design and verification commands live in GROOT_REBUILD.md.
 * README.md retains the original export investigation as explicitly historical notes.
 *
 * One level of detail, deliberately. `skinIndex`/`skinWeight` address vertices by position in the
 * buffer, so decimating a skinned shell leaves the binding pointing at vertices that no longer
 * exist and the figure tears open the moment a clip runs.
