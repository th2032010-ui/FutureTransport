 * Per-channel gain that white-balances the mesh's baked albedo to the reference photograph.
 *
 * The generated GLB's texture is not the reference's bark. Measured over the 56,588 bark vertices
 * (costume excluded), the mesh's median albedo is #3d2d0e, whose blue is 9.4% of its red. The same
 * bark measured off the photograph is #4b3e2b, at 34.3%. **97% of bark vertices have a blue channel
 * under 55% of their red** — Tripo's bake took almost all the blue out of the wood.
 *
 * That is why the figure rendered lime no matter how the lights were balanced, and it is worth
 * being precise about how that was established rather than tuned away: the lit chest measured
 * rgb(72, 78, 7), and switching off the sap, the environment, every point light, the atmospherics,
 * the rim and the hemisphere in turn moved the blue channel by at most 7/255. Nothing in the
 * lighting was responsible. Neither were the cavity and moss tints, which were the next suspects
 * and were also measured and cleared. The albedo itself had no blue to light.
 *
 * These gains are the ratio of the two medians in LINEAR space, which is the space the decoder
 * already leaves vertex colours in. Applying them is a white balance to the reference, not a
 * stylistic grade — it is the step that makes the wood grey-brown wood instead of olive.

/**
 * The costume split.
 *
 * The export ships ONE skinned shell: the leather bracers and gloves are baked into the same
 * 115,350 triangles as the bark. Smooth-skinning a stiff leather sleeve across the elbow and the
 * wrist shears it, which is the smear the reference never shows. So the sleeve triangles are
 * lifted out of the shell and rebuilt as four rigid meshes, each parented to one bone.
 *
 * Which triangles: a vertex belongs to the costume when its dominant bone is a forearm or hand
 * bone AND its distance along the arm axis falls in the measured leather band. The band came out
 * of a warmth profile (median R-G per vertex colour) taken along both arms independently — the
 * leather fraction rises from ~5% on the upper arm to 23-40% over |z| in [0.258, 0.425] and falls
 * back to ~6% past the glove cuff, and it does so at the SAME arm coordinate on the left and the
 * right, which is what makes it a feature rather than noise. The wrist cut at 0.335 is where the
 * hand bone takes over as dominant. A triangle joins a piece when two of its three vertices do.
 *
 * That is a hypothesis confirmed by symmetry and by the render, not a labelled asset: the export
 * carries no material IDs to appeal to.
