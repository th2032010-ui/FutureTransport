 * Groot — the treant from `public/references/monster-tree/front.jpg`, built on the img2threejs
 * playground export and finished under the `animated-character` profile.
 *
 * ONE level of detail, deliberately. The export ships a single `high` level and no lower one, and
 * that is correct for a rigged figure: `skinIndex`/`skinWeight` address vertices by position in
 * the buffer, so a decimation pass that collapses vertices leaves the binding pointing at
 * vertices that no longer exist and the figure tears open the moment a clip runs. Decimating a
 * skinned shell is not a quality trade here — it is a correctness bug.

 * The figure's measured frame, which is NOT what `object-sculpt-spec.json` claims.

 * The spec's `coordinateFrame` says "subject faces -z". The geometry says otherwise: the two

 * centroid at x = +0.034, and the arms run along +/-Z rather than +/-X. So the figure faces +X
 * with the lateral axis on Z.
 *
 * That also settles chirality, which matters because every socket comes in a left/right pair.
 * With forward = +X and up = +Y, right = forward x up = +Z. The rig puts `R_Hand` at z = +0.33
 * and `L_Hand` at z = -0.35, and the measured eye clusters land at z = +0.021 and z = -0.023.
 * The rig's own L_/R_ prefixes therefore agree with the measured geometry — a mirrored pair, not
 * a rotated one.
